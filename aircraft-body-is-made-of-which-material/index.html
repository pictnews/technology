Its initial use was in the 1940s, in fairings, noses and cockpits, and it was also used in rotor blades for helicopters such as the bölkow bo 105 and the bk 117, as well as the gazelle sa 340 in the 1960s and 1970s. Aluminium alloys are characterised by having lower density values compared to steel alloys (around one third), with good corrosion resistance properties. Wood is lightweight and strong, but. This is as aluminium is very light and cheap, but it needs copper as.

These materials give good strength and are easily formed, but they will break and crack if impacted or bent! Some polymers are tough and transparent which makes them suitable for aircraft windows and canopies. Wood was used on most early airplanes and is now mainly used on homebuilt airplanes. composite materials in aerospace application seminar.</p>
