Does a Binge Drinker Need Treatment for Alcoholism? From wellnessretreatrecovery.com
Binge drinking is a style of drinking that is popular in several countries worldwide, and overlaps somewhat with social drinking since it is often done in groups. Since alcohol abuse is defined as heavy drinking on five or more instances in a month, binge drinkers are typically at risk for becoming alcohol abusers, or alcoholics. Binge drinking is an epidemic that has become increasingly popular in the united states, especially on college campuses. Whether you’ve experienced alcohol tremors occasionally after a night of binge drinking or as a more regular event, your body is sending you a message that it’s time to cut back on alcohol.
