However, differences were also found in the association of body weight regulation. Evan johnson, a med associate professor, neema yazdani (med’17), camron bryant, a med assistant professor, vivek kumar of the jackson laboratory, keith babbs, a med senior postdoctoral fellow, david jenkins (grs’19), and lisa. The same genetic variations that are associated with obesity, researchers found, could also predict binge eating among 6,000 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 16. Binge eating is a highly heritable trait associated with eating disorders that is comorbid with mood and substance use disorders.
