It is lightweight compared to other metals or steels, which is important for fuel efficiency and to allow an aircraft to carry more weight. All other metals added to the base metal are called alloying elements. Most airplanes today are made out of aluminum, a strong, yet lightweight metal. There are five basic steps in the process of building an aluminum airplane.
