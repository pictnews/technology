NASA’s Dawn Probe Begins Orbiting Dwarf Ceres The New York Times From nytimes.com
To get to where the voyagers are today in only 5 years would require them to leave earth going more than 115km/s. Telescopes are placed into orbit around the earth or are sent farther out into space to get a clearer view of the universe. Our atmosphere acts like a protective blanket letting only some light through while blocking others. Build background about space probes.

We keep very close track of the spacecraft's position and velocity, and given those, we can predict very precisely where it is going, so running into large objects is not a problem.

<p>Why do astronomers launch telescopes into space? Many countries and private companies have launched probes to planets, asteroids, moons around the solar system,. A probe may operate far out in space, or it may orbit or land on a planet or a moon. Some are used to study a special object like the sun.

<p>Telescopes are placed into orbit around the earth or are sent farther out into space to get a clearer view of the universe. I realize space is a vast place, but with the velocity everything has and the lag on communication how is it possible to avoid a rock (any size would be disastrous)? The main reason we put telescopes into space is to get around the earth’s atmosphere so that we can get a clearer view of the planets stars and galaxies that we are studying. H ow is it possible that the voyager space probes, travelling at 15.4km a second or even faster, manage not to crash into anything on their journeys?presumably even hitting the slightest space.
