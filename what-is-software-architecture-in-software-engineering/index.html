3 Tips for Applying to Software Engineering From designnews.com
Software engineering is a systematic engineering approach to software development. Architecture focuses on relationships and how the elements and components interact with each other, as does software engineering. It serves as a blueprint for software application and development basis for developer team. A technical or software architect concentrates on a particular project, taking care of its development, implementation, maintenance, support, and evolution.
