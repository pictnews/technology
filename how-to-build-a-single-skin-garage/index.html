<p>The typical single skin blockwork of a garage wall is never insulated so failure to properly treat them will result in a significant loss of heat. Spaced away from the brick for a complete thermal break. I want the garage to be roughly 22ft x 12ft, if i have read it correctly then no planning persmission is needed so long as the walls are no higher than 2.5m which is fine. So, they might only have a single skin or single brick layer. WCA's foot, plus qwerty's roof Singletrack Magazine.</p>
