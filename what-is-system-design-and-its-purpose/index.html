This means that a vehicle with a single dual voltage alternator will be capable of powering, simultaneously, both the standard vehicle 12 volt electrical system. We have the ford heavy duty alternator and dual. Systems design could be seen as the application of systems theory to product development. Let&#39;s break it down and understand.
