Kessler Syndrome Definition and a Brief Explanation From scienceabc.com
These include old satellites, rocket bodies, and fragments of exploded or decaying spacecraft. Of course, since then, space junk has become a huge problem. Means that the risk of causing serious damage to functioning spacecraft is significant. When a piece of space junk is created, it will end up either slowing down to fall back toward earth, burning up in the atmosphere or it will crash into another piece of space trash, producing more, smaller projectiles with orbits of their own.

<p>According to the british natural history museum, the primary risk of uncontrolled space junk is the kessler syndrome.what that means is, as satellites and other objects up there in orbit break up, those bits and pieces will continue smashing into themselves, creating more and more clutter, and leaving earth's orbit virtually impassable. Space junk is a huge problem—and it’s only getting bigger.
