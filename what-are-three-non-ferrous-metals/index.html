Standard nonferrous metals are aluminum, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc and their alloys. There are distinct properties in the material, which are primarily pure metals or alloys without any iron.

Density and strength â iron is extremely dense and can be extremely strong when mixed with carbon.
