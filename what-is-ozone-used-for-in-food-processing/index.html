Application of ozone in food processing From slideshare.net
Ozone is a very popular alternative to traditional disinfectants, particularly chlorine. Food researchers are searching for alternative cleaning and sanitizing agents effective against food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, yet harmless to humans and the environment. Another common application of ozone is for food contact surface sanitation. Today, ozone technology is beginning to be used effectively as an additional point of intervention in the food and beverage industry.
