<p>Since cluster sampling selects only certain groups from the entire population, the method requires fewer resources for the sampling process. An individual cluster is a subgroup that mirrors the diversity of the whole population while the set of clusters are similar to each other. Cluster sampling is a probability sampling approach in which researchers split the population into many clusters for research purposes. This means that cluster sampling, when used, gives every unit/person in the population an equal and known chance of being selected in the sample group. What Is Cluster Sampling Visual Guide.</p>

<p>Cluster sampling is a type of probability sampling in which the population is first divided into groups, or clusters, and then a sample of clusters is selected. Systematic sampling and cluster sampling are two different types of statistical measures used by researchers, analysts, and marketers to study samples of a population. The advantage of this method is that it can be used to study populations that are difficult to access. This means that cluster sampling, when used, gives every unit/person in the population an equal and known chance of being selected in the sample group.
