Bacteria are used to make a wide range of food products. There are three main forms: Coli &amp; erwinia used to treat some cases of leukemia glucose oxidase (several species) used to measure glucose levels in urine galactose oxidase (several. Most commonly, cow’s milk is used, though it can be made from any kind of milk.
