&#39;Interstellar&#39; Science Physicist Kip Thorne Writes the Book Space From space.com
Voyager 1, launched in 1977, made the historic entry into interstellar space in august of 2012, reaching the region between stars. The contents of interstellar space are called the interstellar medium. Interstellar space or the physical space between stars or planetary systems within the same galaxy is enormous. Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the sun’s constant flow of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings.

<p>The giant molecular clouds from which stars form tend to have masses of about 10^4 solar masses of gas and dust that has a size of approximately 50 parsecs. This die has a side of 1.5 cm, so it is a little bit larger than what holds 3 x 10^19 molecules of air at sea level, or 1 atom in interstellar space. While interstellar space is fairly empty compared to the air on earth's surface, it is by no means perfectly empty.
