<p>This material and planes made of it launched the era of intercity passenger aviation. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, airplane manufacturers started producing more fuselages from aluminum and steel. Other processes include electroplating, metal finishing (chromating, anodizing, etc.), thermal (plasma or flame) spraying, and heat treating. A few production aircraft also used the duramold construction materials and methods.</p>
