Local handicraft is on sale. Handicraft means a finished product in which the shape or appearance of the natural material has been substantially changed by skillful use of the hands, such as by sewing, carving, etching, scrimshawing, painting, or other means, and which has substantially greater monetary and aesthetic value than the unaltered natural material alone. An activity that involves making something in a skillful way by using your hands. The history of indian handicrafts is as old as the indian civilization of indus valley civilization i.e., almost 5000 years from now.
