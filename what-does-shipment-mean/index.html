There is a good chance that your package will be late if a shipment exception has occurred, because this essentially means that something has gone wrong with the package’s journey. Such shipments are often sent under what are known as freight on board (fob) terms, where the seller agrees to pay costs to move shipments to a port and onto a vessel, but the buyer is responsible for everything else.
