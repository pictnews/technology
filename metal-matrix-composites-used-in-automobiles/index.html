<p>The auto industry can customize lightweight mmcs with a wide variety of properties for use in specific applications to make significant weight reductions and improve fuel efficiency. Composite materials may someday have big advantages over steel in automobile manufacturing. In product development related cases, the analytical network process [15] was used by meade and presley [16] to select the best option for an r &amp; d project. As an example, silicon reinforcement can improve the wear resistance and compressive strength of this lightweight metal. For Lightweight Cars, a Race Among Steel, Aluminum and Carbon Fiber.</p>
