<p>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. Software development is the process programmers use to build computer programs.

<p>We begin by introducing basic programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays, and i/o. Software developers conceive of, design, and build computer programs. The software developer makes use of tools like algorithms and flowcharts to develop the design of the program. In major software projects, this is a job for system analyst, who provides the results of their work to programmers in the form of a program specification.

<p>Cheryl frederick, executive director of stem programs at southern new hampshire university (snhu), said computer programming is a collaborative process, with a variety of programmers contributing during the development of a piece of software. Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building an executable computer program. This makes program b a dependency of program a.
