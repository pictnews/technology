Probes do not have astronauts. S pace probes are not designed to return to earth. For probes to the outer solar system, the power supply will be the limiting factor. At about 1,400 pounds, parker solar probe is relatively light for a spacecraft, but it launched to space aboard one of the most powerful rockets in the world, the united launch alliance delta iv heavy.
