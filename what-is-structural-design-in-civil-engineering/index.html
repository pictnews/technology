<p>Civil engineering is a professional discipline that deals with the design, construction and maintenance of the physically and naturally built environment. In this article named âprocedure of structural designâ, the steps involved in the design process are described. Structural engineering theory is based upon physical laws and empirical knowledge of the structural performance of different materials and geometries. Structural design is a methodical investigation to get the economical specification of a structure or a structural element to carry the predicted load safely.</p>
