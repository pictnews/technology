<p>If it's a very infrequent binge then yes, fasting the following day will help with keeping your weekly calorie amount in check. Very roughly, you burn bmr + activity calories per day. I need to get back in track with my diet after a whole month of binging every single day on over 3000 calories. You will lose the n hours of potential ketosis it will take to process the carbs in your system.</p>

<p>Water fasting may produce such side effects in healthy people after about 24 to 48 hours, but people with health issues may experience them even more quickly. Posted by 3 years ago. If it's a very infrequent binge then yes, fasting the following day will help with keeping your weekly calorie amount in check. Over the weekend i over did it with carbs (after eating low carb for so long) and food in general so much so that i'm feeling super bloated now and i just need to cleanse myself so i'm going my first 48 hour fast. Skipping breakfast, snacking at night may lead to delay in burning body.</p>

<p>So, here i am, stupidly thinking that this binge cycle will end if i manage to fast for 48 hours. For example, if you finished eating around 8pm on sunday, you could fast until 8pm on monday, and then have dinner. I lose my will power, binge,resulting in me wanting to fast again immediately which is heading towards a vicious cycle of binge.fast.binge. If it's a very infrequent binge then yes, fasting the following day will help with keeping your weekly calorie amount in check. Pin en lose 40 pounds before and after.</p>
