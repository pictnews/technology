<p>Since your work is on the field, you will need a valid driver's license. A researcher in the field of ecology for example may conduct field work to understand how specific organisms such as plants and animals relate to one another and to their physical surroundings. A geographical component (the physical presence) and a mental component (the mind of the researcher which defines the field for the study). Even an overwhelming body of evidence may be expanded, or modified, as further work is completed and evidence compiled. PPT Thinking &amp; Working Like A Scientist 8 th Grade PowerPoint.</p>

<p>Science works on the basis that in many areas there will be always more to know. To become a field scientist, you need at least a bachelor's degree in environmental science or any related field with a minimum of a year of relevant experience. Thus for example, amos and reiss6 report that out of eleven alternative strategies for learning science, ‘going on a science trip or excursion.
