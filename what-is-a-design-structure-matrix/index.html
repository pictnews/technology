The design matrix is defined to be a matrix such that (the jth column of the ith row of ) represents the value of the jth variable associated with the ith object. The dsm (design structure matrix) is the basic matrix. Matrix structures are common in organizations delivering many different projects which require different types of expertise across a business. The mind mapping approach just described is an excellent complement to traditional project management tools like the work breakdown structure for helping identify the tasks that need to be executed to complete a project.
