<p>Plane mirrors in physics are the ones that have a flat reflecting surface and produce always a virtual image. Light reflects from a surface with the angle of reflection (compared to a line drawn perpendicular to the surface, which is called the normal) equal to the angle of incidence, the angle of the incoming light. This period carries a total of 12 marks and 23 periods. A plane mirror, in general, is defined as a flat surface of a mirror, on which when light rays fall and are reflected, it produces an image of a particular object in erect and visual form.

The meaning of fresnel mirrors is two plane mirrors hinged so that there is no gap between the edges and so that the two planes make an angle with each other of nearly 180 degrees and used in demonstrating interference phenomena. One of the main characteristics of the plane mirror is that the image formed by the plane mirror is inverted, which means if you raise your left hand then the image of the plane mirror will show the right hand going upwards.

<p>There are two types of reflection in plane mirrors, which are: The light rays falling on the plane mirror are reflected back, forming an image. The incident ray, normal, and reflected ray lie in the same plane. Since the surface is plane, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection for any light ray striking the surface.
