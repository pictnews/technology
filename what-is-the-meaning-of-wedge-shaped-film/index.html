wedge shaped film interference Theory &amp; Derivation wedge shaped From youtube.com
A monochromatic beam of light is made to fall at almost normal incidence on the arrangement. A thin wedge of air film can be formed by two glasses slides on each other at one edge and separated by a thin spacer at the opposite edge. The wedge shaped film has a thin film of varying thickness, having thickness zero at one end and increases at the other. Two open cockpits were located in tandem in the wedge shaped nose.
