The nature of the operations is a factor because the same piece of debris that could cause serious damage to one type of spacecraft might do little harm to a spacecraft with a different configuration or orbital attitude. Orbital debris is a problem that should receive more serious global attention as space is a scarce and valuable resource that humans share. At the end of a spacecraftâs operational life, a final action is performed to remove the vehicle from its orbit. Space Debris Illustrated The Problem in Pictures Universe Today.</p>
