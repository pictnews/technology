<p>There has been a total of 135 space missions using the space shuttle between the years 1980 and 2011 🙂 why don’t they use space shuttles anymore? In addition, oneweb planned to launch its service in 2020, however, after 74 satellites were launched in march 2020, it filed for bankruptcy. The total cost of the investigation was $400 million that involves more than 2,500 workers and over 85,000 pieces of debris. Only two space shuttles, the challenger and the columbia, have crashed.</p>
