<p>One of the best metal used for aircraft body is titanium. It also has a lighter weight compared to. Years ago, aluminum made up seventy percent of the average aircraft, but that percentage has now dipped to around twenty. Early aircraft such as the wright flyer were built with wood and fabric.

<p>Aluminum (blended with small quantities of other metals) is used on most types of aircraft because it is lightweight and. Sometimes called graphite fiber, carbon fiber is a lightweight polymer that is five times stronger than steel and twice as stiff. The objectives and specifications of the aircraft are established during the design and planning process. Other materials that can improve the performance and reduce the cost of aircraft manufacturing are central reinforced aluminum (central) and ceramic matrix composites (cmcs).
