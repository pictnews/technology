<p>To determine if it’s defective, use your tester to check the various electric sparks. A clogged carburetor is most commonly caused by leaving fuel in the leaf blower for a long period of time. If the engine dies after warming up, it is likely the engine is overheating and automatically shutting down to prevent more serious damage. If your leaf blower has a muffler cover or a muffler tip, you will have to remove it before you can access the spark arrestor.</p>
