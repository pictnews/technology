Working of design modeling in software engineering. Process of design engineering during the design process the software specifications are transformed into design models models describe the details of the data structures, system architecture, interface, and components. How we are building is software design. In one word the level of software design is implementation.

<p>It enables the hardware to deliver the expected functionality. Software engineering is a field of design, the process of creating a software project, and a discipline that studies design methods. Unlike a library or framework, which can be inserted and used right away, a design pattern is more of a template to approach the problem at hand. Software design process is the first and foremost step one takes towards building efficient software, making it the most crucial step.
