It does however present a health hazard in some forms. In addition to metals, various types of plastic materials are found in aircraft construction. Sand, gravel, limestone, clay, and marble are examples of nonmetallic minerals. Sedimentary rocks are formed through the aggregation of diverse materials such as minerals, other rock particles, parts of organisms and other organic compounds.

<p>Metallic minerals is composed of metals in their original form, whereas no metals are found in. Sedimentary rocks are formed through the aggregation of diverse materials such as minerals, other rock particles, parts of organisms and other organic compounds. They range from colorless gases (like hydrogen) to shiny and high melting point solids (like boron).the electrons in nonmetals behave differently from those in metals. These materials often have an elastic, plastic, or viscous response to stressors, which—coincidentally—are some examples of nonmetal objects. EDU HELP 10th ScienceMetals and Non Metals.</p>
