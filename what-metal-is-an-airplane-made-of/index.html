What materials make up most of the weight of an aircraft? Aviation From aviation.stackexchange.com
For different metals, well, in a jet engine, you&#39;ll have steels, titanium and nickel based alloys. Airplane wings are made out of a specific type of aluminum, an alloy that offers a combination of lightness and strength comparable to steel that makes for easy flying. Today, aircraft engineers value steel for its durability, hardness and resistance to high temperatures. The metal gives the aircraft the properties needed to maintain the structure.
