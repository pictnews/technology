In contrast to traditional blood tests, arterial blood gases (abgs) provide the doctor with values of six different components that must be interpreted as a single result. Blood which has passed through the capillaries of various tissues, except the lungs, and is found in the veins, the right chambers of the heart, and the pulmonary arteries; In clinical practice, this is typically the arm.

<p>Ph value determines the presence of acidosis or alkalosis in the blood. The test is used to check the function of the patient’s lungs and how well they are able to move oxygen into the blood and remove carbon dioxide. There is currently a plague of ‘venous’ blood gases (vbg) in clinical practice. Venous blood is deoxygenated blood which travels from the peripheral blood vessels, through the venous system into the right atrium of the heart.deoxygenated blood is then pumped by the right ventricle to the lungs via the pulmonary artery which is divided in two branches, left and right to the left and right lungs respectively.
