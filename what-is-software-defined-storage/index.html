<p>This can be used to. Sds abstracts hardware storage and storage controllers into a separate layer pulled into a single pool and later available for most optimal use and distribution around the cluster. Storage virtualization is designed to create multiple virtual machines from a single device, reducing hardware costs. While most data storage products do require both software and hardware to function—with the software serving as the management component to control and monitor the hardware.

<p>Therefore, all management functions are exposed through apis enabling sds to integrate with any management stack, vmware, openstack, microsoft, etc. Sds resources may be spread across multiple servers and pooled or shared as if they reside on one physical device. This allows separate pools of physical storage resources to be managed together as a single logical device. Each storage node is responsible for storing a subset of the overall data.
