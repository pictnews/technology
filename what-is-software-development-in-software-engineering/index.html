So while a software developer only concerns themself with building components for a piece of software, a software engineer is involved with the entire development process. Not all software developers, however, are engineers. Successful software developers and engineers exhibit similar traits:</p>

What the software engineering meaning doesn’t explain is that everything that has been software engineered needs. A software engineer is an expert in applying the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software, whilst a software developer is one who develops software that runs across different kinds of computers.</p>

The process, also known as the software development life cycle (sdlc), includes several phases that provide a method for building products that meet technical specifications and user requirements. But i think that isn't exactly accurate and not really the way most people think of it, computer science is a useful subset of knowledge for creating software but i think software engineering is mostly about other things.
