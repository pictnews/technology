Survival evolved fortitude skill is a measurement of the player’s total resistance to various environmental hazards such as disease, torpidity, and weather. It just ignores the 8th stat (crafting skill) and tries to calculate the points without that stat, causing it. The higher your crafting skill, the higher the chance you will get better stats on the item that you are crafting. Higher crafting skill reduces the amount of time it takes to craft an item, allowing you to craft more items in a shorter amount of time.
