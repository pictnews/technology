Pioneer probes conducted various missions, including some of the first lunar probes, investigations of conditions in interplanetary space, exploration of the planet venus, as well as the first flybys of jupiter and saturn. The voyager probes are both travelling in the general direction of pioneer 11. By the time pioneer reached saturn it was being closely followed by the voyager probes.

<p>Most probes transmit data from space by radio. Pioneer 4 made it to within 60,000 km of the moon in 1959 but had been upstaged by the soviet luna i which had passed within. A probe may operate far out in space or it may orbit or land on a planet or a moon. As the planning went on additional tasks were included like further exploring the planet saturn and its magnetic field. Pioneer 10 in the final stages of construction in 2021 Space probe.</p>
