<p>Vertical polarization refers to the oscillation of an antenna’s electrical field on the vertical plane, whereas horizontal polarization refers to the oscillation on the horizontal plane. Horizontal line equation is y = 2. When used as nouns, axial plane means any plane that divides the body into superior and inferior parts, roughly perpendicular to spine, whereas horizontal plane means any plane that divides the body into superior and inferior parts, roughly perpendicular to spine.
