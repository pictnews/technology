Structural design patterns are those software design patterns in which the focus is on the relationship between classes and objects. Lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which. Structural patterns can be used in the design stages or the expansion stages of the projects. Structural pattern matching in python 3.10.
