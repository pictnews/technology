All Time Air Conditioning Explains Why the AC Compressor Not Working From prunderground.com
If the breaker for the air conditioner outside unit fan is not working and trips and the indoor unit works, the ac system won’t emit cold air or stop spinning altogether. The unit isn’t receiving power. If your outside ac fan stops working, it will be easy to notice by peaking into the condenser from above. On the control board of your ac unit, a thermistor monitors the temperature of the air.
