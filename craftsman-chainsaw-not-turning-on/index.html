<p>The clutch pads engage the clutch drum to allow the chain to rotate. In my experience, there are two possible causes of this ‘bogging down of the engine’ and to resolve this the manufacturer’s manual is required or alternatively a little internet investigation. A clogged carburetor is often caused by leaving fuel in the chainsaw for a long period of time. As a result, starting the engine can be difficult or impossible.

<p>I would suggest that in the first instance the carburetor settings are checked. An old, dirty, damaged or improperly attached sparkplug can cause hindrance, and the chainsaw won’t start. Stop the engine from turning by first unscrewing and removing the spark plug, and then screwing in a piston stop, which is a metal cylinder that prevents the piston from moving. When the trigger is released, the chainsaw drops back to idle speed. Craftsman 20&quot; Chainsaw Bid On Estates.</p>

<p>As the chainsaw idles, the crankshaft is no longer spinning fast enough to turn the chain, and you. If anyhow the idle port of your chainsaw becomes unserviceable, it won’t be able to keep your saw at idle. This sticky fuel can clog up the carburetor and cause the chainsaw engine to stall. A carburetor combines the fuel and the air to start the engine’s internal combustion. Kid's Toy Chainsaw Set CMXTYRB65001 CRAFTSMAN.</p>

<p>An electric chainsaw will stop working for different reasons than one that uses fuel like petrol and a motor with air filters and spark plugs.
