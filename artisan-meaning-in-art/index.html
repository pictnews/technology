Glossary of Art Terms and Definitions Painting Mediums From painting.about.com
Arty and artsy both describe artists, but the terms have developed a pejorative sense of pretension, and artsy is hyphenated in combination with craftsy and, worse, fartsy, to refer to someone with such airs, or a creation of theirs. An artisan is someone whose job requires skill with their hands. Someone who produces works like paintings or sculpture, or works in the performing arts, or is skilled at a particular task or occupation. In the creation of an artisan, a spark of creativity can be observed.
