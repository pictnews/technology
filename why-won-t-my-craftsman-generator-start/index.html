<p>With the generator running, make sure the ac power is turned on and the breaker is not tripped. The easiest way to test this is to get a piece of wood, and place it on the side of the fuel float. If it is just dirty, you may be able to just gently tap it against a surface to clean it off, but air filters are. To test this, remove the control panel to expose the backside of the start switch.

<p>Use a multimeter to measure the ac voltage by placing the black lead in the smaller slot on the right (of a 120v outlet) and the red lead in the longer slot on the left. Look to see if the porcelain insulator shows signs of cracks or is missing pieces if it looks like the ground electrode is damaged (ground electrodes should look round). You can use a tester to find out if this. If your air filter is clogged, your generator may not start. Winter Driving Why Won't My Car Start? MotorEasy.</p>

<h3 id="to-fix-this-problem-clean-or-replace-the-carburetor">To Fix This Problem, Clean Or Replace The Carburetor.</h3><p>One of the common causes your generac generator won’t start because the gasoline is old. If you can get the generator to start, run it for a few minutes, and then plug the oil sensor back in. For generators fueled by propane, make sure that the tank has enough gas and that all the valves and tubing in the tank are opened. With the generator running, make sure the ac power is turned on and the breaker is not tripped.</p>
<h3 id="any-fuel-that-is-more-than-two-months">Any Fuel That Is More Than Two Months.</h3><p>You can pull the air filter out and see if it’s clogged. Gasoline tends to degrade over time. If the porcelain insulator is cracked, an electrode is burned away or damaged, or there is heavy carbon buildup at the electrode, replace the spark plug. Make sure your oil is full and your oil filters aren’t blocked.</p>

You can also check to see if the oil sensor is to blame by unplugging it from the crank case. Inspect the spark plug for signs of wear. When you’ve got your generator all set up, make sure that the fuel is flowing into the tank properly.</p>
<h3 id="replace-if-your-cap-is-broken-or-you-are-unable-to-get-your-cap-to-vent">Replace If Your Cap Is Broken Or You Are Unable To Get Your Cap To Vent.</h3><p>On many generators, it can be found directly above the air filter on the.
