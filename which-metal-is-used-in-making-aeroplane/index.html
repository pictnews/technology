<p>When a manufacturer builds a plane, they need to make sure it can lift off the ground. Hence, the metal used to make aeroplanes is aluminium. Having a carbon content of 0.3% to 0.5%, this type of steel is highly suitable for machining connecting rods and light forgings with sufficient surface hardness. It is lightweight compared to other metals or steels, which is important for fuel efficiency and to allow an aircraft to carry more weight.

Other processes include electroplating, metal finishing (chromating, anodizing, etc.), thermal (plasma or flame) spraying, and heat treating. Why is aluminum used to make airplanes? In addition, the purpose of an airplane goes a long way in the manufacturers’ decision to use a particular type of metal, especially the metal used in the plane’s frame and body.

<p>Junkers’ work was noticed by henry ford, who borrowed heavily from it (too heavily, said junkers, and sued him) to make the ford trimotor in 1925. Several materials can be used for major structures—wings, fuselage, or landing gear, for example—on different types of aircraft. The wright brothers' first aeroplane, which first took off in 1903, had a 30 pound aluminium block in the engine. They are made out of specialized alloys and require precision cutting to maintain their weight and structural integrity. The Uses Of Stainless Steel In Aircraft Aluminium Trading.</p>
