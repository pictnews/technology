Basic structure of the atom. All these things that you have ever heard about it from anywhere is the hypothesis (imagination) of various scientist because it is almost impossible to get. Orbitals are classified according to the four quantum numbers that represent any one particular orbital&#39;s energy, shape, orientation, and the spin of the occupying electron. Most of the atom is empty space.

<p>Around the year 1911, british physicist ernest rutherford, carried out the famous gold foil experiment to understand the structure of an atom. An element’s atomic structure refers to its nucleus and it’s constitution, how and of what material it is made up of.
