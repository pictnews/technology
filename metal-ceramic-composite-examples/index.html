<p>A broad category of composite materials that include a honeycomb structure, a mass of hexagonal cells inspired by the shape of the honeycombs produced by bees in their nests. They can also be amorphous or have inhomogeneous chemical composition, which develops upon pyrolysis of organic precursors. The reason for this property of sic fibers is that most of them contain additional elements like oxygen, titanium and/or aluminum yielding a tensile strength. This predates the use of metal.
