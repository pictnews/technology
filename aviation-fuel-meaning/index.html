U.S. Navy Turns Seawater into Jet Fuel, Flies Aircraft using Ocean’s From anonhq.com
An alternative to conventional aviation fuel available in the near term is aviation biofuel, sometimes termed sustainable aviation fuel (saf). The chemical and physical characteristics of sustainable aviation fuels are almost identical to those of conventional jet fuel, meaning the two can be safely blended together.
