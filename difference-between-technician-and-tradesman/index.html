As technology gets more complex, technicians are useful. The main difference between a mechanic and a technician is that a mechanic is more involved in repair stuff when a product gets damaged, while a technician is more into the maintenance part. I would say tradesman to refer to a group of different workers in a space without a generalization, if someone referred to me as a tradesman i would not be upset about it. While tradesman as a noun is a skilled manual worker.
