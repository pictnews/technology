Symptoms Bulimia Nervosa From psych36bulimia.weebly.com
A few months ago i started binging weekly, sometimes for days in a row. Binging or purging does not occur exclusively during episodes of behavior that would be common in those with anorexia nervosa. I dont exercise because i am unable to and i dont purge so to compensate for the binges i fast for the rest of the week. I was wondering if there was anyone on here whos a nonpurging bulimic like me, because all the posts i see are from purging bulimics and i guess i feel kind of discouraged.
