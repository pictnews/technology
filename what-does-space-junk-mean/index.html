An Interview with Kevin R. Grazier, Science Consultant for GRAVITY From amazingstories.com
Space junk, or space debris, is any piece of machinery or debris left by humans in space. If it’s lower than the iss, then it won’t last long in space anyway. The rocket is what is called ‘space junk’—disused machinery, such as rockets and satellites, which had originally been sent to space but never returned to earth. Space junk is any human made stuff that has been left behind.
